# Accompanying Scripts for my Technical Report "Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for MIP.

Scripts and data reported used to write my article about Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search. 
A preprint can be accessed on Optimization Online [here](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2018/12/6992.html)

The repository is organized into subdirectories as follows.

1. "experiments/" contains bash scripts and SCIP settings for running the experiments with [SCIP](https://scip.zib.de/)
2. "all-rewards/" contains R scripts to simulate bandit selection strategies on the measured rewards
3. "alns-final-evaluation" contains some raw MIP performance data to be processed by [IPET](https://github.com/GregorCH/ipet)
